This is a web-based version of the Hodgkin and Huxley simulator (HHsim) created by 
David S. Touretzky, Mark V. Albert, Nathaniel D. Daw, Alok Ladsariya and Mahtiyar Bonakdarpour. 
The simulator was a fantastic tool for my learning, but it is no longer compatible with newer versions of Matlab. 
I'm making this project a) to make this tool more accessible and b) because I want more coding practice lol

I encourage you to check out the original simulator here: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/HHsim/

All brilliance in this simulator is from them; any mistakes are mine.
